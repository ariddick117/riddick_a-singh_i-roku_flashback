# Roku Flashback App

Welcome to Roku Flashback! A streaming service for old and new. Watch your favourite classics by logging in and choosing on of three categories (Movies, TV, and Music). Show the classics to your kids with the child-protected section.

## Description

You will be building an audio / video app in the Authoring class, using queries and database assets that you’ll be compiling (or have compiled) in the Advanced Web class. Create assets based on the Roku Flashback brief (to be supplied) to create the layout, views and components you will be working with.
This project requires two roles - designer and developer. Because there are usually more of one than the other, you’ll have to adapt to the demands of the project throughout its lifecycle. Inother words, approach this as a true team - the designer might have to help with some code challenges, and vice versa.
Use the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySql and PHP) for the server side and Vue.js as your front-end framework. You can re-use most of your work from the fall term - your movie API that you did in the Web class. You’ve got a couple of endpoints set up, queries written etc; you’ll need to expand on those and adapt it to work with AJAX / JavaScript.
A user should be able to log in, filter and select a movie, tv show, or audio based on user profile (adult or kids). This means that you’ll have to restrict access to some content based on age or ratings, and your users will need rights and priveleges as well. The UX / UI should update based on the user (children / adults) - create 2 themes, and render the appropriate theme on login.
